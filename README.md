# Yemen-info

Here is JSON file for the most information for Yemen programmatically.

## TODO

We can learn a lot from [this project](https://github.com/dr5hn/countries-states-cities-database)

- [x] Add Tashkeel in addition to Arabic names. we can use these automatic service at the beginning: [modaqiq](https://dictionary.alc.ae/modaqiq), then we add Tashkeel manually based on people who know them.
- [x] add phone code code for every city.
- [x] add custom cspell dictionary for spell checkers, to ignore Yemeni cities/governance's names. [Here](https://github.com/Yemeni-Open-Source/Yemen-info/blob/main/.cspell/custom-dictionary-workspace.txt) you can find it and copy the text and paste it in any text editor that have the functionality of spelling dictionary and the user dictionary, like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, or Even [Arabic - Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-arabic) extension on VS Code.
- [ ] add script to convert json file automatically to: CSV, SQLite, YAML and other useful formats.
- [ ] add descriptive and better Readme file.
- [ ] add another Arabic Readme file beside the English Readme.
- [ ] add automatic script to add all cities/governance's names to cspell dictionary.
- [ ] add an id for every governance and districts.
- [ ] order governance/districts by name.
- [ ] add capital districts for every governance.
- [ ] add text_normalization for every governance/districts in both Arabic and English.

## Later On Future

This list for todos that are not in our scope now, but if we have time and resources we may do it, or we can do it separately in another repo.

- [ ] Add polygon for map coordinates
- [ ] Add latitude and longitude for map coordinates in governance / districts centers.
